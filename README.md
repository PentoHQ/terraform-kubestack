## Introduction

[Kubestack is a Gitops framework](https://www.kubestack.com) for managed Kubernetes services based on Terraform and Kustomize.

### Features
* Provides full testability of configuration changes
* Clearly separates infrastructure and applications (`ops` & `apps` cluster pair)
* Ensures K8s cluster config, surrounding infrastructure (e.g. DNS, IPs) and cluster services (e.g. Ingress) are maintained together
* Unifies application environments across cloud providers
* Increases deployment confidance through local deployments that accurately mirror cloud deployments
* Enables a sustainable and fully automated GitOps workflow


## Getting Started

For the easiest way to get started, [visit the official Kubestack quickstart](https://www.kubestack.com/infrastructure/documentation/quickstart). This tutorial will help you get started with the Kubestack GitOps framework. It is divided into three steps.

1. Develop Locally
    * Scaffold your repository and tweak your config in a local development environment that simulates your actual cloud configuration using Kubernetes in Docker (KinD).
3. Provision Infrastructure
    * Set-up cloud prerequisites and bootstrap Kubestack's environment and clusters on your cloud provider for the first time.
4. Set-up Automation
    * Integrate CI/CD to automate changes following Kubestack's GitOps workflow.

See the [`tests`](./tests) directory for an example of how to extend this towards multi-cluster and/or multi-cloud.


## Repository Layout

This repository holds Terraform modules in directories matching the respective provider name, e.g. [`aws`](./aws), [`azurerm`](./azurerm), [`google`](./google). Additionally [`common`](./common) holds the modules that are used for all providers. Most notably the [`metadata`](./common/metadata) module that ensures a consistent naming scheme and the `cluster_services` module which integrates Kustomize into the Terraform apply.

Each cloud provider specific module directory always has a `cluster`, `cluster-local`, and `_modules` directories. The cluster module is user facing and once Kubestack is out of beta the goal is to not change the module interface unless the major version changes. The cluster module then internally uses the module in `_modules` that holds the actual implementation. The cluster-local module is similar to the cluster module, but configured for local deployments.

The [`quickstart`](./quickstart) directory is home to the source for the zip files that are used to bootstrap the user repositories when following the quickstart documentation.

The [`tests`](./tests) directory holds a set of happy path tests that also act as a example of how to do multiple cluster pairs across multiple clouds from one repository.
